                <p class="text-gray-800 mt-2">Happy, happy birthday, baby! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’– Today is your special day, and even though I canâ€™t be there to celebrate with you in person, I want you to know that my heart is with you every second. I hope today is filled with so much joy, love, and all the things that make you happy because you deserve nothing less.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 mt-2">It feels so surreal that weâ€™ve reached another milestone togetherâ€”your <strong>25th birthday</strong>. Iâ€™m beyond grateful that I get to be part of your life, to witness you grow, achieve your dreams, and become the amazing person that you are. Every day with you is a gift, and I cherish every moment we share, whether near or far. I truly hope and pray that weâ€™ll get to celebrate many, many more birthdays together in the years to come.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 mt-2">I just want to take this moment to remind you how <strong>proud I am of you</strong>â€”for everything youâ€™ve accomplished, for how strong and resilient you are, and for the kind heart that you always show to the people around you. You inspire me in so many ways, and Iâ€™m lucky to call you mine. No matter what happens, I will always be here for you. My shoulder will always be yours to lean on, my ears will always be open to listen to your thoughts, and my heart will always be yours to hold.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 mt-2">I hope you take time today to celebrate yourself because you are so, so loved. Eat good food, smile a lot, and donâ€™t forget that Iâ€™m thinking about you every second. <strong>You are my favorite person in the world</strong>, and I canâ€™t wait for the day when we can finally spend moments like this together, side by side.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 mt-2">Hereâ€™s to you, to us, and to all the birthdays weâ€™ll celebrate together in the future. I love you endlessly. ðŸ’–âœ¨</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">- Love, Olive</p>
